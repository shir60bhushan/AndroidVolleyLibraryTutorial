============================

This code is about the integrating the volley networking library for doing the fastest network operations
At Google I/O last year, the search engine giant showcased a faster way to make network requests within an Android application by introducing the Volley networking library. Volley includes a lot of features useful for managing network requests and their response caches in a fast and easy way.
One can use Volley to run simultaneous requests on a pool of threads that can be given priority over another. In addition, it can be used to handle JSON requests, image request or files of that size and nature.
In this tutorial, we will learn how to setup Volley for Android and write a sample code to make a JSON request.
Advantages of Volley library

a)  Automatically schedules the network requests

b) Supports request prioritization. This means that you can load content depending of priorities, for example the main content could have a high priority, but the images a low priority.

c) Provides transparent disk and memory cache that allows for quick reloading of data. Transparent cache means that the caller doesnâ€™t have to know about the existence of the cache. That is, the cache is implemented automatically. You do, however, have the possibility to disable the caching.

d) Provides a good API for canceling requests. You can cancel a single request, or cancel requests depending on some filters.
